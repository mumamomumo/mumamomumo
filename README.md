## About me

I enjoy coding, and I love the feeling of solving a problem on my own, without any AI :D

I love learning, and I love the satisfaction when I understand something that was difficult to me.

I enjoy meeting new people, and I enjoy learning new stuff from other people.

I'm out of project ideas :d

## Proud Projects
[Yet Another Productivity App](https://anotherproductivity.vercel.app/) - An app made with React, Typescript, bundled with Tauri. I didn't use Rust for this app. It's available on the web too.

[This thing](https://github.com/mumamomumo/ui-testing-thingy) - A little project to practice CSS.

[Pomodoro Thingy](https://github.com/mumamomumo/pomodoro-thingy) - A pomodoro timer that looks like a Nintendo Gameboy. The buttons work, and you can input numbers with the keyboard. No games on it though... yet
