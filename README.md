*Yet another profile readme*

## About me
I am yet another 16 year old that's interested in coding.

I want to try everything but end up trying nothing. I start a lot of projects, end up finishing none of them.

I enjoy coding, and I love the feeling of solving a problem on my own, without any AI :D

I love learning, and I love the satisfaction when I understand something that was difficult to me.

I enjoy meeting new people, and I enjoy learning new stuff from other people.

I love being positive, because why should I intentionally bring negativity into my life by criticizing, judging, or hating people?


## Currently making / Plan to make
* Yet another productivity app - Almost done. I used this to learn React and Tauri
* Paint app with Python AI trained with the MNIST dataset - Used this to learn NNs in Python with Numpy, still WIP
* Snippet Vault - To learn the basics of meta-frameworks, authentication, and database stuff.

## What I might make
Nothing yet...


## Dropped projects :(
* AI that can connect to APIs automatically
