*Yet another profile readme*

## About me
I am yet another 16 year old that's interested in coding
I want to try everything but end up trying nothing. I enjoy coding. I start a lot of projects, end up finishing none of them. Always starting on yet another project, but never finishes it

## Currently making / Plan to make
* Yet another productivity app - Almost done. I used this to learn React and Tauri
* Paint app with Python AI trained with the MNIST dataset - Used this to learn NNs in Python with Numpy, still WIP
* Snippet Vault - To learn the basics of meta-frameworks, authentication, and database stuff. 

## What I might make
* Yet another personal assistant - To learn about language processing and speech to text stuff
* Yet another app for fun
